# CPIT210 Course Project
Introduction about your project, describe the problem, and your solution. Project truth tables, expressions, k-maps and any related task must included here. Also project documentation must included.

In this project students should work in groups of 3 to implement a fully functioning sequential circuit. This sequential circuit should work as a Buffer, a competition circuit, or 4-way light circuit depending on the student's choice. The idea of the three projects will be explained in the lab. To design the circuit, Logisim should be used. Students should submit their software implementation and the report here.

## Calculator
#### Problem Statement
This circuit is used to perform three arthimatic operations Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication of two numbers with 8 bits. Students required to build required components from the basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT gates). Implementation should contains design of half adder, full adder, and 8 bits parallel binary adder. Subtraction and Multiplier should implemented using full adder as described in following diagrams. You are not allow to use pre-designed Adder, Subtractor, and Multiplier, you mush build them from scratch.

## Grading Factors
Each student's grade will defer from his group-mate 
- content and organization
- stating the problem need to be solved
- explanation of each component used
- explanation of whole circuit/integration of component
- how often you update/participate/contribute in group repository
